#### Secret Escapes home ask for iOS developers

Welcome to your home task. The goal of this task is to test your general knowledge of the iOS world and your ability to write clean, testable and scalable code.

#### The project

The project has the bare minimum setup for displaying a list of sales retrieved from a GraphQL endpoint.

#### Requirements

We are expecting you to show us your best by: 

* refactoring the architecture using clean, testable (and **tested**), scalable patterns. As you can imagine, our real app is very complex, especially the homepage (sales feed) and it must be stable, flexible to future changes, easy to maintain and scalable
* adding a loading indicator when loading the sales 
* adding error feedback for the user in case it fails
* fixing any irregularities or potential problems that you may see in the code 
* adding a details screen that gets opened when you click a sale card, and display the title and the `hotelDetails` field, which is part of the GraphQL schema. A fancy UI is not important for us, we are more focused on your approach from the architectural point of view and cleanliness.

#### Guidelines

Feel free to integrate any libraries you might find beneficial, keep in mind anyway that we are interested in your code ;-)

In refactoring, even if you have full freedom, we would like to see solutions that are similar to those you could find in our project: MVVM and Reactive Programming. About the latter, we use the library ReactiveSwift, but any other reactive library works just fine.

If you don't manage to implement everything that you'd like to show us, a document is a good solution.

You can send your home-task back to us via email with a zip file.

Have fun!
